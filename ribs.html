                    <p>Start your smoker for a temperature of 120Â°C (248F) with some smoke wood.
                        Take the membrane off the back of the ribs with a small kitchen knife and a piece of paper towel. Look for thin loose pieces of meat and trim those off.
                        Put all the ingredients for the dry rub in a shaker and mix it. Put on some olive oil on the meat and put an even layer of dry rub on. Place the ribs in the smoker for 3 hours to pick on some smoke.
                        Take the ribs out and wrap them in aluminum foil with some butter and apple juice. Now put the package back.
                        After 2 hours take the ribs out of the smoker and the foil. Let them rest for 10 minutes and serve with your favorite bbq sauce.
